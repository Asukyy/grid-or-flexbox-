   <strong> ‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a<br>
    transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
    for<br> the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
    The next 12<br> weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
    the course, I‚Äôve<br> successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù</strong>

    <strong>‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve<br> never written a line of code. I needed<br> some structure from
    professionals<br> who can help me learn programming<br> step by step. I was encouraged to<br> enroll by a former
    student of theirs<br> who can only say wonderful things<br> about the program. The entire<br> curriculum and staff
    did not<br> disappoint. They were very hands-on<br> and I never had to wait long for<br> assistance. The agile team
    project, in<br> particular, was outstanding. It took<br> my learning to the next level in a way<br> that no tutorial
    could ever have. In<br> fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during<br> interviews as an example of my<br> developent
    experience. It certainly<br> helped me land a job as a full-stack<br> developer after receiving multiple<br> offers.
    100% recommend! ‚Äù</strong>
